---------------------------------------------------
-> Wasn't made to be incorporated into their github branch and as such this proj wasn't forked
---------------------------------------------------

To run this version:

1) make //if not yet compiled
2) reload.sh
3) go to a different terminal, and call cmd.sh p, where p is you're desired parameter
	valid p:
		- next
		- prev
		- rand
		- beg
		- 0-9 (jump to track)
		- stop
---------------------------------------------------
4) to add songs to the playlist
	Go to /music

	run createLib.sh music.ogg n //where n is the given track number, for example if you currently
				       have track 1-9, and you want to add a tenth, call
				       createLib.sh tenth.ogg 10
				       NOTE: this script is only valid for ogg files

	go to /tracks and open your newly created trk'n'.c file.

	update the track's length (the Array size value that was outputted when calling createLib.sh)


	Supposing we added a TENTH track to the playlist:

	Add "netcat-y+= tracks/trk10.o" to the Makefile

	Add "extern struct netcat_track netcat_cpi_trk10;" to netcat_main.c file
	Add "&netcat_cpi_trk10", to the  netcat_track struct in netcat_main.c file
